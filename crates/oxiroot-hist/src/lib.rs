//! Classic ROOT histograms read (and, later, write).
//!
//! These histograms serialize through ROOT's `TStreamerInfo` mechanism and are
//! the histogram objects actually stored in ROOT files. (ROOT 7 `RHist` has no
//! persistable on-disk format — its `Streamer` throws — so it is intentionally
//! out of scope.)
//!
//! Supported for reading: `TH1D`/`TH1F`, `TH2D`/`TH2F`, `TH3D`/`TH3F`, and
//! `TProfile`. Bin contents are widened to `f64` regardless of on-disk
//! precision; the exact class is preserved in `class_name`.
